The pre-go-live end-to-end check. Verdict from the design pass: **xrdp is the full,
wired product — validate and ship it; grd is NOT a multi-user/fleet box yet** (its
session primitive is proven, but `run.sh.grd` doesn't pass `USER*`/`FLEET_SSH`, the
entrypoint never `tailscale up`s, and there's no grd wizard — a tracked follow-up).
So **this runbook validates the xrdp lineage** as the go-live product.

Two parts: **(A) spikeable** (throwaway container on any host) and **(B) real-deploy-only**
(needs a live tailnet + the dev box and host actually up — *this* is the maintainer's
"fleet tiles reachable through Tailscale + Guacamole working" ask, and it cannot be faked).

---

## A — spikeable (cheap, run first, any host)

Proves the session + the **multi-user** mechanism (the one thing not yet exercised on main):

```sh
./validation/xrdp-headless-spike.sh            # core + u1, one :3389, each paints its own :1x
NUSERS=4 ./validation/xrdp-headless-spike.sh   # core + u1..u3
```
**PASS** = `A/C:3389 PASS` + every user `paint=PASS` + one `:1x` per user in the session list.
(The grd session primitive is already proven: `./validation/grd-headless-spike.sh` + `NUSERS=3 …`.)

**VALIDATED GREEN on erebus 2026-06-24** (NUSERS=2): core + u1 each painted their own XFCE
`:1x` over the shared `:3389`, live `xfwm4`+`xfce4-panel` per user. Getting there surfaced a
**load-bearing dependency for the desktop to paint at all on Fedora 44**: SVG icons now decode
via `glycin` inside a **`bwrap` sandbox**, which needs the container security flags
(`--security-opt label=disable` + `--cap-add SYS_ADMIN` + `--device /dev/fuse`) — without them
GTK can't load an icon, hits `g_error()`, and the whole XFCE session **aborts (exit 134)**.
Both production deploy paths already carry these (`run.sh:108-113`, the Quadlet's
`SecurityLabelDisable=true`/`AddCapability=…SYS_ADMIN`/`AddDevice=/dev/fuse`). **Treat them as
desktop-critical, not just nested-podman plumbing — a future "SELinux hardening" that drops
`label=disable` would silently stop the desktop painting.** (The other three spike fixes —
xrdp key ownership, `~/.Xclients`, `dbus-uuidgen` machine-id — are things production already
does; they were throwaway-image gaps, not product gaps.)

**BACKEND finding + fix (2026-06-24).** The first green above used xrdp's *auto-selected* session,
which on Fedora 44's stock `xrdp.ini` (`[Xorg]` commented, only `[Xvnc]` active) is **Xvnc** — so
it validated the Xvnc backend, not the xorgxrdp/Xorg one the lineage is built for. Investigation
(see PR #38 thread) found production was effectively serving **Xvnc** too: the `xrdp-sesrun -t Xorg`
pre-warm *does* create an Xorg session (it reads `sesman.ini`, where `[Xorg]` is enabled), but
every incoming connection took the only-active `[Xvnc]` section and forked a **separate Xvnc**
session — orphaning the pre-warm. **Fix: PR #41** uncomments `[Xorg]` + sets `autorun=Xorg` in
`install.sh`. **Re-VALIDATED GREEN on the Xorg backend** (`RDP_BACKEND=xorg`, NUSERS=2): core + u1
each paint their own `/usr/libexec/Xorg` `:1x` (backend gate: Xorg procs=2, Xvnc procs=0). The
spike now defaults to `RDP_BACKEND=xorg` and **fails** a run that silently falls back to Xvnc.
Still real-deploy-only on Xorg: the pre-warm + cross-device resume (bpp=24), and audio/H.264 on
the native-RDP-over-tailnet path.

---

## B — real-deploy validation (the go-live gate)

Deploy on the **production-class host on the tailnet**, with the **dev box and host actually up
on the tailnet** and the fleet SSH path in place. Throwaway containers can't do this.

### B0 — preconditions (must be true first)
- The deploy host can run the image; for grd only, it needs cgroup-v2 delegation (xrdp doesn't).
- The **fleet hosts** (`fedora-dev`, the VPS/`erebus`) are **up, on the tailnet, sshd reachable**, and the tailnet **`ssh` ACL grants this desktop node action `accept` (NOT `check`)** to them — keyless Tailscale-SSH then authenticates the node by tailnet identity (check-mode needs a browser re-auth a headless node can't do; see B3 + `ZTNA-ACCESS.md`). (`FLEET_SSH_KEY` is only for a target whose real sshd is reachable on `:22`, not these Tailscale-SSH-fronted hosts.)
- Decide MagicDNS vs IP: `tailscale up` here omits `--accept-dns`, so in-container name resolution of `fedora-dev`/`erebus` is **not guaranteed** — prefer the `100.x` tailnet IPs in `FLEET_SSH` unless you've confirmed MagicDNS resolves inside the container.

### B1 — deploy xrdp with the full secret set
```sh
RDP_PW='<strong>' GUAC_PW='<strong>' WEB_PORT=8443 \
FLEET_SSH='fedora-dev 100.x.x.dev 22 core;erebus 100.x.x.host 22 core' \
USER1_NAME=jenny USER1_PW='<strong>' USER1_ACCESS=none \
USER2_NAME=bob   USER2_PW='<strong>' USER2_ACCESS=all \
USER3_NAME=dev1  USER3_PW='<strong>' USER3_ACCESS=fedora-dev \
USER4_NAME=ops1  USER4_PW='<strong>' USER4_ACCESS=erebus \
TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-... IMAGE=ghcr.io/oso-gato/fedora-desktop:latest ./run.sh
```
(or `./spin-up.sh` interactively — it drives `run.sh`). **Label each fleet tile by its tailnet
hostname** (the wizard's per-host picker does this for you). A `USERn_ACCESS` grant is `none` |
`all` | a comma-list of tile hostnames (e.g. `fedora-dev,erebus`), matched **exact-whole-token,
fail-closed** — the retired `dev`/`host`/`both` vocabulary grants NOTHING (substring matching was
removed with the exact-label fix, PR #43).
If deploying via the **Quadlet** instead of `run.sh`, first **uncomment** the per-user `Volume=` lines
in `fedora-desktop.container` (else extra users lose `/home` on recreation) and note the Quadlet has
**no fleet env** — fleet tiles work only via `run.sh` today.

### B2 — the go/no-go gates (ALL must pass)
1. **Healthy:** `podman inspect -f '{{.State.Health.Status}}' fedora-desktop` → `healthy` (the #32 cmd = `:8443` 200 **and** `/dev/tcp :3389` open **and** `mariadb-admin ping`).
2. **Web + TOTP:** browse `https://<public-ip>:8443/guacamole/` → login `core`/`GUAC_PW` → TOTP QR on first login, code on next → painted **XFCE** desktop in the browser.
3. **Multi-user paint:** log in as `jenny` (USER1) → her **own** painted session (the least-proven path — watch for a black second session).
4. **Access-grant matrix:** `jenny`(`none`)→Desktop only · `dev1`(`fedora-dev`)→Desktop+`ssh-fedora-dev` · `ops1`(`erebus`)→Desktop+`ssh-erebus` · `bob`(`all`)→Desktop+every tile · `core`→Desktop+all. Then **downgrade** `bob` to `fedora-dev` and redeploy → the `ssh-erebus` tile is **revoked**.
5. **★ Fleet over Tailscale (the primary ask):** as `core`, click **`ssh-fedora-dev`** → a real shell on the **dev box**; click **`ssh-erebus`** → a real shell on the **host** — both **over the tailnet** (not public). Confirm the source is this node's tailnet IP.
6. **Cross-device resume:** RDP as `jenny` from device A, disconnect, reconnect from device B at a **different** geometry → the **same** session resumes (apps still open) — the bpp=24 invariant.
7. **auth-ban:** 3 bad web logins → source IP locked out ~900s.

### B3 — known traps to watch (from the design pass)
- **MagicDNS:** fleet tiles dial nothing if names don't resolve in-container → use `100.x` IPs (see B0).
- **Keyless Tailscale-SSH through guacd works IFF the tailnet ACL action is `accept`, not `check`** (verified erebus 2026-06-25): under `check` the tile hangs on an unsatisfiable browser re-auth (headless node, no browser); under `accept` it connects clean. Fix = set the desktop node's `ssh` ACL to `accept`. `FLEET_SSH_KEY` does NOT help Tailscale-SSH targets (Tailscale SSH intercepts `:22`, ignoring keys).
- **No healthcheck probes a fleet tile** → a down/unauthorized bastion is invisible to health/rollback; B2-gate-5 is a **manual** click-probe.
- **TOTP enrollments live in the `/var/lib/mysql` volume** → losing it wipes all 2FA; do a backup/restore drill before go-live.
- **Any granted fleet tile = a `core`-admin shell** on that fleet box via keyless Tailscale-SSH (ACL `accept`-mode) as `core@<target>` (per CLAUDE.md) — confirm that's intended for the users you grant it to.

## B — RESULTS (real deploy on erebus, 2026-06-25)

xrdp lineage, image `ghcr.io/oso-gato/fedora-desktop:latest` (endpoint-verified digest `9963a288`),
multi-user. Two passes are recorded here: the **first** (core + jenny/none + bob/both) caught a
production-only crash (the gid note below); the **final GREEN pass** (core + `bear-alchemist`/[erebus,
fedora-dev] + `piguet-fatima`/[fedora-dev]) confirmed every gate on a container whose running image
digest was verified to be the fixed build.

| Gate | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| B2-1 Healthy | ✅ PASS | `podman inspect` → `healthy` (web 200 + `:3389` open + mariadb ping) |
| B1 Xorg backend | ✅ PASS | Xorg procs=1, Xvnc procs=0, session on `:10` — #41 backend live + `xrdp-sesrun` pre-warm present |
| B2-2 Web + TOTP | ✅ PASS | public-IP `:8443` login `core`/`GUAC_PW` → TOTP QR enroll → painted XFCE in the browser |
| B7 Shared folder | ✅ PASS | jenny WROTE `/home/shared`, bob READ + APPENDED via the default `group:deskshare:rwx` ACL; `/home/shared` = `root:deskshare 2770`; bob DENIED jenny's `0700` home |
| gid-collision fix | ✅ PASS | jenny home `jenny:jenny` **gid 8001** (the reserved 8000+n range) — the #45 `gid==uid==1000+n` scheme had collided with 1Password's baked gid 1001-1003 and crashed PID 1; **#48** moved GID→8000+n + made the chown numeric/non-fatal; redeploy clean |
| B2-5 ★ Fleet tiles | ✅ PASS | keyless Tailscale-SSH through guacd: after setting this desktop node's tailnet `ssh` ACL to `accept` (was `check`), the `ssh-dev` + `ssh-vps` tiles open **live `core@` shells** on fedora-dev + erebus; both container probes return a clean `OK`, no check banner. **The fix was the tailnet ACL, not a key** — Tailscale SSH intercepts `:22` so `FLEET_SSH_KEY` never reaches the OS sshd (the earlier "key required" call was wrong, now corrected). The ACL `accept` lives in the tailnet admin console (outside this repo) — record it in the deploy runbook. |
| B3/B4 Multi-user paint + per-host grants | ✅ PASS | `core`/`bear-alchemist`/`piguet-fatima` each paint their OWN XFCE; tiles match the per-host grant exactly — `bear`→`ssh-erebus`+`ssh-fedora-dev`, `core`→all 3, **`piguet`→`ssh-fedora-dev` ONLY** (the comma-list matcher #57). Was straight-to-desktop on the stale image; correct on the verified one |
| polkit dialog | ✅ PASS | **NO "XFCE PolicyKit Agent" error window** on any user's desktop — suppressed via `Hidden=true` in `/etc/xdg/autostart/xfce-polkit.desktop` (#64, source-validated against `xfce4-session`'s autostart reader) |
| B2-6 Cross-device resume | ✅ PASS | `bear-alchemist` disconnect → reconnect from a different-sized device resumes the SAME session, apps still open (the bpp=24 `<User,BitPerPixel>` invariant) |
| B2-7 auth-ban | ✅ PASS | ~5 bad web logins → source IP locked ~900s |

**VERDICT: GREEN — full xrdp production proof passed end-to-end on erebus (2026-06-25), image
`9963a288` (`ghcr.io/oso-gato/fedora-desktop:latest`), endpoint-verified.** Every gate — healthy,
Xorg backend, public web + TOTP, multi-user paint with **no polkit dialog**, the **per-host grant
matrix**, keyless fleet shells, cross-device resume, shared-folder collab, auth-ban — passed on a
container whose **running image digest was confirmed** (`podman inspect <ctr> --format '{{.Image}}'`
== the built digest) to be the verified build.

**Two operator facts that belong in the deploy runbook (not code):**
1. **The fleet `ssh` ACL must grant the desktop node `accept` (not `check`)** — a tailnet admin-console
   setting; keyless Tailscale-SSH through guacd then opens the tiles, no key. A FRESH tailnet node
   (after a `-state` wipe) needs this re-granted (tag the node / scope the rule).
2. **★ Verify the RUNNING image, not just the registry/pull.** This proof was delayed ~2h by an
   exported `IMAGE=…:xrdp` that made `spin-up.sh` silently deploy a FROZEN local tag while every
   `podman pull` targeted `:latest` — the running container was never the fixed image. ALWAYS run
   `podman inspect <ctr> --format '{{.Image}}'` and compare to the intended digest after deploy.
   Mitigations now shipped: `spin-up.sh` prints the image it deploys (#65) and `run.sh`/`run.sh.grd`
   use `--pull=newer` (#66) so a deploy fetches the current tag.

---

## grd (NOT go-live for multi-user/fleet)

grd's headless GNOME session is host-proven (single + multi-user) via `grd-headless-spike.sh`,
but as shipped `run.sh.grd` passes only `RDP_PW/GUAC_PW/RFB_PW/TS_AUTHKEY`, never joins the
tailnet (`entrypoint-grd.sh` has no `tailscale up`), and has no spin-up wizard — so grd is
**core-only, no fleet tiles**, and **has never been CI-built**. Ship **xrdp** for production;
grd's fleet/multi-user deploy gaps are a separate follow-up.
